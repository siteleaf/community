# Siteleaf Community

Welcome to the [Siteleaf Community](https://github.com/siteleaf/community/discussions). We look forward to building an open, accessible, and searchable archive for questions that pop up often. We also hope to offer a greater level of transparency by opening up our roadmap and allowing the community to vote on new features.

To get started we created topics for:

- ‚ùì [Community Support](https://github.com/siteleaf/community/discussions/categories/community-support): Ask the community for help with Jekyll and Siteleaf.  

- üí° [Feature Requests](https://github.com/siteleaf/community/discussions/categories/feature-requests): Vote and share ideas for new features.  

- üôå [Show & Tell](https://github.com/siteleaf/community/discussions/categories/show-tell): Show off something you've made.  

- üí¨ [General Discussion](https://github.com/siteleaf/community/discussions/categories/general-discussion): Everything else. 


## Official support for paid customers

In addition to the **community support** here, offical **customer support** is included in all [paid plans](https://www.siteleaf.com/plans/) (Personal, Team, Business, and Enterprise). To send an official support request, [log into your site](https://manage.siteleaf.com) and click the chat button at the bottom right of your page.
